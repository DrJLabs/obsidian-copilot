# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.2 â€” Autonomous Runner Integration

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 4
- Fully Covered: 4 (100%)
- Partially Covered: 0 (0%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: With `parallelToolCalls.enabled` active, `AutonomousAgentChainRunner` mirrors sequential marker behavior for visible tools while suppressing background markers

**Coverage: FULL**

- test_file: `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/__tests__/parallelExecution.test.ts`
  - test_case: `updates markers for visible tools only and records telemetry`
  - Given: Coordinator flow receives visible and background tools with concurrency enabled
  - When: Hooks fire in and out of order through `executeToolCallsInParallel`
  - Then: Marker updates apply only to foreground tools and background placeholders remain untouched, matching sequential expectations
  - coverage: unit

#### AC2: Ordered tool results feed directly into `processToolResults`, yielding prompt/context strings identical to the sequential path

**Coverage: FULL**

- test_file: `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/__tests__/parallelExecution.test.ts`
  - test_case: `preserves prompt aggregation parity with sequential flow`
  - Given: Coordinator helper executes two tools under concurrency
  - When: Results feed into `processToolResults`
  - Then: Aggregated output matches sequential baseline byte-for-byte
  - coverage: unit

#### AC3: Runner respects `parallelToolCalls.enabled` and clamps concurrency 1..10, falling back to sequential when disabled or misconfigured

**Coverage: FULL**

- test_file: `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/parallelConfig.test.ts`
  - Scenario suite covering disabled flag, clamping, and fallback behavior
  - coverage: unit

#### AC4: Abort, timeout, and error handling reuse single-call logic without firing post-abort UI updates while preserving logging

**Coverage: FULL**

- test_file: `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/__tests__/parallelExecution.test.ts`
  - test_case: `suppresses marker updates after abort`
  - Given: AbortController triggered mid-execution
  - When: Hooks attempt to settle an in-flight tool
  - Then: Results capture cancellation while UI markers avoid new visible updates post-abort and telemetry records cancellation
  - coverage: unit

### Remaining Follow-ups

1. **Performance Bench Validation**
   - Capture production telemetry or synthetic benchmark run before enabling flag by default.

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None.
- **Medium Risk**: Performance bench pending.
- **Low Risk**: All other requirements covered by automated tests.
