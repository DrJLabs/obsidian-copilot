# NFR Assessment – Story 1.3 Copilot+ Integration & Telemetry

Date: 2025-09-29
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

Assessed NFRs: security, performance, reliability, maintainability

## Security — PASS

- Coordinator path reuses existing gating/normalization; no new surface area added.
- Concurrency respects feature flag and background tools remain non-visible, avoiding leakage.
- Recommendation: none; monitor telemetry for unexpected tool surge signals.

## Performance — PASS

- `parallelExecution.test.ts` now asserts `[parallel] execution summary` durations and `emitToolSpan` payloads, satisfying benchmark scenario 1.3-INT-005.
- Recommendation: monitor production telemetry using the same duration thresholds when flag expands.

## Reliability — PASS

- Abort propagation validated via `CopilotPlusParallelExecution` suite; sequential fallback exercised when flag misconfigured.
- Coordinator inherits parallelExecution tests ensuring ordered aggregation and background suppression.

## Maintainability — PASS

- Shared coordinator path keeps logic centralized; new tests use jest mocks consistent with existing suites.
- README updated to reflect new helper signature; lint tooling now deterministic with added dependencies.

### Summary

- Overall quality score: 100
- Key follow-up: maintain telemetry alerting once feature flag widens.
