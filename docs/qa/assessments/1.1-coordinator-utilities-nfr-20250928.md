# NFR Assessment — Story 1.1 Coordinator Utilities

Date: 2025-09-28
Assessor: QA Agent (Quinn)

## Scope

- Security
- Performance
- Reliability
- Maintainability

## Summary

All assessed NFR attributes meet expectations for the coordinator utility layer. Evidence comes from the architecture shard (`docs/architecture/*.md`), the updated unit test suite (`src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/toolExecution.test.ts`), and story-level dev notes.

## Detailed Findings

### Security — PASS

- Coordinator reuses existing gating/timeout normalization; no new I/O paths or data exposure introduced. (`docs/architecture/10-security-privacy.md`, `docs/architecture/5-coordinator-design.md`)
- Abort handling now cleans up listeners and suppresses post-abort updates, preventing resource leaks that could expose stale state.
- No secrets or configuration changes required; existing Plus gating still enforced in sequential wrapper tests.

### Performance — PASS

- Concurrency cap defaults to 4 with clamp 1..10, satisfying `docs/architecture/5-coordinator-design.md` and `docs/architecture/9-performance-targets.md` expectations.
- Scheduler ensures bounded in-flight calls and early refill on completion; unit test `preserves input ordering with staggered resolution` exercises mixed latency scenario.
- Future telemetry instrumentation (Story 1.3) already noted; no regressions identified.

### Reliability — PASS

- Abort flow updated to prevent late settle from overwriting cancelled results, ensuring deterministic behaviour consistent with `docs/architecture/11-backward-compatibility.md`.
- Unit tests cover error mapping, timeout propagation, and cancellation outcomes.
- Hooks only fire when not aborted, preserving UI consistency and avoiding ghost updates.

### Maintainability — PASS

- Tests added for every coordinator branch (ordering, errors, timeout, abort), meeting Story AC5 and testing strategy guidance.
- Helper utilities (`flushMicrotasks`, `waitForCallCount`) encapsulate fake-timer semantics for future reuse, improving readability.
- No new external dependencies introduced; code stays within existing utility module.

## Quality Score

- All assessed attributes PASS → score 100

## Recommendations

- Monitor telemetry once runner integration lands to validate performance improvements on real workloads.
- Keep helper utilities in shared test toolkit if additional concurrency suites are added.
