Quality Score: 90 / 100

## Summary Table

| NFR             | Status | Notes                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security        | PASS   | Reuses sequential gating/timeouts; no new data surfaces.                                                                                       |
| Performance     | PASS   | Telemetry summary logging plus unit benchmark confirm concurrency reduces synthetic wall time; capture production metrics before flag rollout. |
| Reliability     | PASS   | Abort suppression and marker parity now verified via `parallelExecution.test.ts`; coordinator flow handles cancellation safely.                |
| Maintainability | PASS   | Execution logic extracted to reusable helper with focused unit tests; story/docs updated.                                                      |

## Details

### Security — PASS

- Coordinator still delegates to `executeToolCall`, keeping Plus gating/timeout normalization centralized.
- No secrets or additional persistence introduced; span logging uses existing logger safeguards.

### Performance — PASS

- Positive: `executeCoordinatorFlow` emits `[parallel] execution summary` log for each run, enabling telemetry dashboards; config sanitized to 1..10.
- Telemetry-backed unit benchmark shows concurrency reduces synthetic wall time; capture real benchmark before enabling flag by default.
- Action: Run synthetic benchmark (e.g., 10× webSearch mocks) and archive metrics under QA evidence.

### Reliability — PASS

- New unit tests assert foreground markers update once and background markers stay silent under concurrency; abort path confirmed to avoid additional UI updates.
- Coordinator helper ensures cancelled calls propagate error state without corrupting history.

### Maintainability — PASS

- Core iteration logic extracted into `executeCoordinatorFlow`, easing future runner reuse and testing.
- Added targeted tests and documentation references to guide future maintainers.
