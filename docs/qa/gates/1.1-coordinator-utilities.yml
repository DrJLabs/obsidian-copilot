  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Coordinator reuses existing gating; abort cleanup prevents stale updates."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Concurrency clamp aligns with architecture targets; unit tests cover mixed latency."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Abort guard prevents post-cancel overwrites; error/timeout mapping verified."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Unit suite covers all AC5 scenarios; helpers improve fake-timer determinism."
