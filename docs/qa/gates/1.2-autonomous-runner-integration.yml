  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: Reuses sequential gating/timeouts; no new data surfaces.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: Telemetry summary logging plus unit benchmark confirm concurrency reduces wall time.
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Abort and marker parity validated in parallelExecution tests.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Logic extracted to reusable helper; new targeted tests.
