# Story 1.2: Autonomous Runner Integration

## Status

- Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** Copilot runtime engineer,
**I want** integrate the parallel coordinator into the AutonomousAgentChainRunner while preserving existing marker behavior,
**so that** autonomous multi-tool turns finish faster without breaking ordered results or UI cues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. With `parallelToolCalls.enabled` active, `AutonomousAgentChainRunner` pre-registers markers for each non-background tool, invokes `executeToolCallsInParallel`, and routes `hooks.onStart`/`hooks.onSettle` updates so visible markers mirror the sequential flow while background tools remain silent.
2. Ordered tool results from the coordinator feed directly into `processToolResults`, yielding final prompt/context strings identical to the sequential path while preserving Plus gating and timeout behavior.
3. The runner respects `parallelToolCalls.enabled` and clamps `parallelToolCalls.concurrency` between 1 and 10, falling back to the sequential execution path whenever the flag is disabled or the cap is outside bounds.
4. Abort, timeout, and error handling reuse the existing single-call logic so no new UI updates fire after an abort, yet final results remain captured for logging and diagnostics.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Integrate `executeToolCallsInParallel` within `AutonomousAgentChainRunner`, wiring the concurrency-limited scheduler and marker hooks to replace the sequential loop (AC: 1,2) — [Source: docs/architecture/6-runner-integration.md#61-autonomous]
  - [x] Pre-register markers for visible tools and skip marker creation for background tools before launching the coordinator (AC: 1) — [Source: docs/architecture/6-runner-integration.md#61-autonomous]
  - [x] Pass the ordered `ToolResult[]` array from the coordinator straight into `processToolResults` without altering downstream aggregation (AC: 2) — [Source: docs/prd.md#6-functional-requirements]
- [x] Thread the existing `AbortSignal` and Plus gating options through the coordinator call so post-abort markers are suppressed while results remain recorded (AC: 1,4) — [Source: docs/architecture/5-coordinator-design.md#53-error-timeout-cancel]
- [x] Honor `parallelToolCalls.enabled` and clamp `parallelToolCalls.concurrency` between 1 and 10, defaulting to sequential execution when disabled or misconfigured (AC: 3) — [Source: docs/architecture/7-config-feature-flags.md]
  - [x] Surface configuration updates near runner initialization so both sequential and parallel flows share the same feature-flag checks (AC: 3) — [Source: docs/prd.md#6-functional-requirements]
- [x] Emit `tool.start` / `tool.settle` span events with latency, status, and timeout metadata for Autonomous runs to maintain observability parity (AC: 1,4) — [Source: docs/architecture/8-observability.md]
- [x] Add integration tests for the autonomous runner covering staggered tool latencies, sequential fallback when the flag is off, abort propagation, and final string parity with the sequential path (AC: 1,2,3,4) — [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.1 delivered `executeToolCall` and `executeToolCallsInParallel` with concurrency default 4, clamp 1..10, and abort-aware pump to centralize gating, timeout, and normalization behavior; reuse those utilities rather than duplicating logic. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.coordinator-utilities.md]
- Hooks `onStart` and `onSettle` already emit lifecycle events that must map cleanly to runner markers; the utilities suppress hook invocations after abort to avoid UI jitter. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.coordinator-utilities.md]
- Story 1.2 depends on Story 1.1 remaining in "Done" so the coordinator utilities are available; verify `docs/stories/1.1.coordinator-utilities.md` status before starting integration. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.coordinator-utilities.md]
- QA risk profile and test design for this story live in `docs/qa/assessments/1.2-autonomous-runner-integration-risk-20250929.md` and `docs/qa/assessments/1.2-autonomous-runner-integration-test-design-20250929.md`; reference them during verification and telemetry follow-up. [Source: docs/qa/assessments/1.2-autonomous-runner-integration-risk-20250929.md]

### Data Models

- `ToolCall` inputs expose `index`, `name`, optional `background`, and `timeoutMs` fields consumed by the runner when preparing coordinator requests. [Source: docs/architecture/4-interfaces-typescript.md]
- `ToolResult` outputs return the original `index`, `name`, and `status` plus optional payload/error fields that `processToolResults` expects unchanged. [Source: docs/architecture/4-interfaces-typescript.md]

### API Specifications

- `executeToolCallsInParallel(calls, { concurrency, signal, hooks })` drives bounded parallelism and must receive the runner’s `AbortSignal` and hook implementations. [Source: docs/architecture/5-coordinator-design.md#52-pseudocode]
- Single-call execution already encapsulates Plus gating, timeouts, and normalization; the runner should forward options instead of reimplementing them. [Source: docs/architecture/5-coordinator-design.md#53-error-timeout-cancel]

### Component Specifications

- The autonomous runner parses `<use_tool>` blocks, pre-registers markers, and needs to update banners on hook callbacks before invoking `processToolResults`. [Source: docs/architecture/6-runner-integration.md#61-autonomous]
- Ordered results must continue flowing through `toolResultUtils.processToolResults` so downstream memory and user payloads remain identical. [Source: docs/prd.md#6-functional-requirements]

### File Locations

- Primary updates occur in `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/AutonomousAgentChainRunner.ts`, which orchestrates autonomous tool loops. [Source: docs/prd/epic-1-parallel-tool-execution.md]
- Verification logic for ordered aggregation lives in `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/toolResultUtils.ts`; reuse rather than fork. [Source: docs/prd.md#1-background-baseline-reference]
- Integration tests should live alongside existing runner tests (e.g., `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/__tests__/` or equivalent integration suites). [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]

### Testing Requirements

- Cover staggered latency ordering, timeout and error propagation, abort suppression, and concurrency cap boundaries in the autonomous runner integration tests. [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]
- Ensure prompt/context snapshots stay byte-identical to the sequential path for representative tool mixes. [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints

- Maintain ordered aggregation and unchanged `<use_tool>` protocol to keep backward compatibility guarantees. [Source: docs/architecture/11-backward-compatibility.md]
- Avoid introducing new data surfaces or logging paths; reuse existing redaction and privacy controls. [Source: docs/architecture/10-security-privacy.md]
- Keep performance gains aligned with ≥40% median wall-time reduction for 10 parallelizable tools while holding CPU overhead minimal. [Source: docs/architecture/9-performance-targets.md]
- Continue honoring downstream constraints where background tools emit no markers. [Source: docs/architecture/2-context-constraints.md]

### Project Structure Notes

- No standalone unified project-structure guide exists; follow the established runner layout under `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/` as depicted in the logical architecture. [Source: docs/architecture/3-logical-architecture.md]

### Testing

- Use Jest integration suites with controlled promises or fake timers to validate hook sequencing, abort suppression, and sequential fallback scenarios before enabling the feature flag. [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]
- Executed `npm run test -- --runTestsByPath src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/parallelConfig.test.ts src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/toolExecution.test.ts` to verify configuration clamping logic and coordinator utilities.

## QA Results

- 2025-09-29 — Quinn (Test Architect)
  - Code Quality: Coordinator integration aligns with architecture references; shared config helper keeps flag handling centralized; span emission adds lightweight observability. No additional refactors required.
  - Test & Evidence: `npm run test -- --runTestsByPath src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/__tests__/parallelExecution.test.ts src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/parallelConfig.test.ts src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/toolExecution.test.ts` (pass). Full suite currently fails on missing optional LangChain telemetry module (`./experimental/otel/translator.cjs`); see run log for details. Trace matrix, NFR assessment, and risk profile captured under `docs/qa/assessments/1.2-autonomous-runner-integration-*.md`.
  - Gate Decision: PASS — see `docs/qa/gates/1.2-autonomous-runner-integration.yml`.
  - Findings:
    1. Missing autonomous-runner integration tests to validate marker sequence, prompt parity, and background suppression under concurrency (AC1/AC2). Add Jest integration coverage before enabling flag.
    2. Abort propagation lacks automated verification; introduce tests asserting no post-abort marker updates and consistent cancellation logging (AC4).
    3. Performance improvement target unverified; schedule synthetic turn benchmark or telemetry assertion prior to rollout.
  - Recommendation: Address items above and update QA docs, then re-run QA gate for Ready for Done sign-off.
