# Story 1.3: Copilot+ Integration & Telemetry

## Status

- Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** Copilot runtime engineer,
**I want** adopt the parallel coordinator and observability hooks inside the CopilotPlusChainRunner,
**so that** Copilot+ multi-tool turns finish faster while keeping UI markers, context assembly, and telemetry identical to the sequential experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. With `parallelToolCalls.enabled` active, `CopilotPlusChainRunner` routes tool execution through the coordinator with the configured concurrency cap (clamped 1–10) and reuses `hooks.onStart` / `hooks.onSettle` so foreground markers update exactly like the sequential flow while background tools remain silent.
2. Ordered `ToolResult[]` output from the coordinator feeds the existing Copilot+ aggregation path (`processLocalSearchResult`, `prepareEnhancedUserMessage`, `addFallbackSources`, and `processToolResults`) so prompt/context strings, citations, and localSearch formatting remain byte-identical to the legacy sequential execution for the same inputs.
3. Copilot+ runs emit `tool.start` / `tool.settle` telemetry spans with duration and status metadata plus a bounded summary log of tool durations, enabling FR10 metric collection without duplicating instrumentation.
4. Feature flag and abort safeguards match prior behavior: the runner falls back to the sequential loop whenever the flag is disabled or misconfigured, threads the existing `AbortSignal`, and suppresses post-abort marker updates while still recording final results for diagnostics.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Replace the sequential `executeToolCalls` path with a coordinator-backed helper that mirrors the Autonomous runner integration while preserving Copilot+ streaming hooks (AC: 1,2) — [Source: docs/architecture/6-runner-integration.md#62-copilot]
  - [x] Pass `processLocalSearchResult`, source deduplication, and `ActionBlockStreamer` marker plumbing through `executeCoordinatorFlow` so localSearch and UI streaming behave unchanged (AC: 2) — [Source: src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/parallelExecution.ts]
  - [x] Reuse `resolveParallelToolConfig` (or equivalent) to clamp concurrency from settings and surface fallback to sequential when parallel execution is disabled (AC: 1,4) — [Source: docs/architecture/7-config-feature-flags.md]
- [x] Thread Copilot+ tool metadata (names, background flag, temporary IDs) into coordinator hooks so foreground markers update on start/settle and background tools stay hidden (AC: 1) — [Source: docs/architecture/6-runner-integration.md#62-copilot]
- [x] Emit `tool.start` / `tool.settle` spans and the `[parallel] execution summary` log for Copilot+ runs, ensuring telemetry attributes include tool name, status, duration, and concurrency (AC: 3) — [Source: docs/architecture/8-observability.md]
- [x] Preserve sequential fallback, abort propagation, and Plus gating by forwarding the existing `AbortSignal`, tool manager options, and feature checks through the coordinator wrapper (AC: 4) — [Source: docs/architecture/5-coordinator-design.md#53-error-timeout-cancel]
- [x] Add integration tests covering: mixed-latency tool sets, localSearch-only runs, sequential fallback when the flag is off, abort handling, and telemetry span emission for Copilot+ (AC: 1,2,3,4) — [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]
- [x] Update PRD/architecture references and QA trace docs after telemetry integration so gating artifacts stay current (AC: 3,4) — [Source: docs/prd/6-functional-requirements.md]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.1 delivered the coordinator utilities (`executeToolCall`, `executeToolCallsInParallel`) with abort-aware scheduling; reuse that shared core rather than duplicating tool manager logic. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.coordinator-utilities.md]
- Story 1.2 proved the coordinator flow inside `AutonomousAgentChainRunner`, including marker wiring, concurrency clamp, and telemetry spans—mirror those patterns for Copilot+. [Source: docs/stories/1.2.autonomous-runner-integration.md]
- QA gate 1.1 tracks remaining risks tied to runner adoption; close TECH-001 once Copilot+ integration lands and the risk profile is rerun. [Source: docs/qa/gates/1.1-coordinator-utilities.yml]

### Data Models

- `ToolCall` / `ToolResult` contracts (index, background, status, payload) remain the source of truth for coordinator inputs and outputs. [Source: docs/architecture/4-interfaces-typescript.md]

### API Specifications

- `executeCoordinatorFlow` wraps `executeToolCallsInParallel` and already exposes hooks for marker updates, telemetry emission, and localSearch processing—integrate Copilot+ through that API. [Source: src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/parallelExecution.ts]
- `resolveParallelToolConfig` enforces `parallelToolCalls.enabled` and `concurrency` bounds; Copilot+ must defer to it for consistency across runners. [Source: docs/architecture/7-config-feature-flags.md]

### Component Specifications

- `CopilotPlusChainRunner` must maintain `ActionBlockStreamer`, `ThinkBlockStreamer`, and citation assembly behavior when swapping in the coordinator helper. [Source: src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/CopilotPlusChainRunner.ts]
- `ToolManager.callTool` continues to provide sequential semantics (timeouts, Plus gating, normalization); the coordinator wrapper must forward Copilot+ options without modification. [Source: docs/prd/6-functional-requirements.md]

### File Locations

- Update `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/CopilotPlusChainRunner.ts` for the primary integration and stream plumbing. [Source: docs/architecture/6-runner-integration.md]
- Extend coordinator utilities or tests under `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/` and `__tests__/` as needed for Copilot+-specific coverage. [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]

### Testing Requirements

- Integration tests must exercise Copilot+ with: (a) multiple visible/background tools, (b) localSearch-only responses, (c) abort scenarios, (d) sequential fallback with flag off, and (e) telemetry assertions (spans/log metadata). [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]
- Maintain deterministic fixtures so prompt/context outputs match sequential snapshots per acceptance criteria. [Source: docs/prd/8-acceptance-criteria.md]

### Technical Constraints

- Preserve byte-identical outputs for prompt/context assembly and citations to avoid regression in downstream summarization. [Source: docs/architecture/11-backward-compatibility.md]
- Avoid duplicating telemetry sinks; reuse coordinator span emitters and summary logs for observability consistency. [Source: docs/architecture/8-observability.md]

### Project Structure Notes

- Copilot+ is the last runner depending on the sequential tool loop; ensure the coordinator helper remains reusable for future runners or feature variants. [Source: docs/architecture/3-logical-architecture.md]
- Feature flag defaults stay off until rollout step 3; keep configuration surface identical between runners. [Source: docs/architecture/13-rollout.md]

### Follow-Up Tasks

- [ ] Coordinate with QA to refresh the Copilot+ risk profile and trace matrix once telemetry and tests land. — Owner: QA Agent, Due: Post-dev — [Source: docs/qa/gates/1.1-coordinator-utilities.yml]
- [ ] Capture benchmark data comparing sequential vs parallel Copilot+ runs before expanding the rollout cohort. — Owner: Dev Agent + SRE, Due: Pre-flag enablement — [Source: docs/architecture/9-performance-targets.md]
