# Story 1.1: Coordinator Utilities

## Status

- Done

## Story

**As a** Copilot runtime engineer,
**I want** build concurrency-aware tool execution utilities that wrap the existing single-call pathway,
**so that** multi-tool turns finish faster without breaking ordered results, gating, or UI markers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `executeToolCall` in `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/toolExecution.ts` delegates to the existing single-call logic and returns a `ToolResult` that preserves current timeout, gating, and normalization behavior.
2. `executeToolCallsInParallel` consumes an array of `ToolCall` inputs, uses a concurrency-limited scheduler (default 4, clamped between 1 and 10), and respects overrides supplied through `ExecOptions` including `AbortSignal` support.
3. The scheduler writes each `ToolResult` to its original index, invoking `hooks.onStart` and `hooks.onSettle` for both foreground and background tools while keeping downstream ordered aggregation identical to the sequential path.
4. Abort, timeout, and error cases reuse the single-call handling so no new calls launch after cancellation, post-abort UI updates are suppressed, and final results remain captured for logging.
5. Unit tests cover staggered latency ordering, error/timeout propagation, abort suppression, and concurrency cap boundaries per the architecture testing strategy.

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- No previous stories exist for Epic 1; this draft establishes the coordinator baseline.

### Data Models

- `ToolCall` inputs include index, optional id, name, args, optional background flag, and timeout per interface definition. [Source: docs/architecture/4-interfaces-typescript.md]
- `ToolResult` outputs must carry the originating index, name, `ToolStatus`, optional payload, and error strings for downstream aggregation. [Source: docs/architecture/4-interfaces-typescript.md]

### API Specifications

- `executeToolCall(call, { signal })` invokes the existing tool manager path so gating, timeouts, and normalization remain centralized. [Source: docs/architecture/5-coordinator-design.md#53-error-timeout-cancel]
- `executeToolCallsInParallel(calls, opts)` accepts optional `concurrency`, `signal`, and `hooks` parameters and returns a `Promise<ToolResult[]>`. [Source: docs/architecture/5-coordinator-design.md#52-pseudocode]

### Component Specifications

- No UI components change in this story; downstream banners keep consuming ordered results unchanged. [Source: docs/architecture/3-logical-architecture.md]

### File Locations

- Implement utilities within `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/toolExecution.ts` alongside existing sequential helpers. [Source: docs/prd/epic-1-parallel-tool-execution.md]
- Place unit tests adjacent to the utility (e.g., `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/toolExecution.test.ts`). [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests must cover ordering with staggered latency, timeout propagation, error mapping, abort handling, and cap limits. [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]
- Integration, snapshot, and chaos coverage are deferred to later stories focused on runner adoption. [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints

- Maintain deterministic ordered aggregation to keep final prompt/context strings byte-identical vs sequential execution. [Source: docs/architecture/11-backward-compatibility.md]
- Do not introduce new data surfaces; reuse existing redaction and logging behavior. [Source: docs/architecture/10-security-privacy.md]
- Ensure concurrency cap defaults to 4 with clamp bounds 1..10 and is feature-flag configurable. [Source: docs/architecture/5-coordinator-design.md#51-scheduling]

### Project Structure Notes

- No dedicated unified source tree document exists; align updates with the existing `src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/` utility structure described in the logical architecture diagram. [Source: docs/architecture/3-logical-architecture.md]

### Testing

- Follow unit test guidance in docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md to implement targeted utility tests before runner integration. [Source: docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]

### Tooling Guidance

- **FOSS-first Recommendation:** Use built-in `AbortController` and a minimal queue implementation; optionally reference `p-limit` patterns without adding dependencies.
- **Paid Option (if required):** None; existing tooling is sufficient.
- **Automation / Scripts:** Add Jest helper to create deferred promises and control resolution timing.

### Risk & Compliance Notes

- **Residual Risks:** Moderate â€“ concurrency caps rely on configuration; misconfiguration could exhaust I/O slots.
- **Compliance / Control Mapping:** Maps to ASVS 5.2.4 (interrupting processing safely) and 9.1.2 (deterministic behavior under concurrency).
- **Monitoring / Observability:** Ensure span hooks emit `tool.start`/`tool.settle` metrics with abort flag for dashboards.
- **Rollback / Contingency:** Toggle `parallelToolCalls.enabled` false to revert to sequential execution.

### Follow-Up Tasks

- [x] Add Jest concurrency tests covering staggered latencies and abort cases â€” Owner: Dev Agent, Due: 2025-10-05

## QA Results

- **Test Design:** `docs/qa/assessments/1.1-coordinator-utilities-test-design-20250928.md` â€” 9 scenarios (Unit 6 / Integration 2 / E2E 1) covering all ACs with 4 P0 tests.
- **Risk Profile:** `docs/qa/assessments/1.1-coordinator-utilities-risk-20250928.md` â€” Gate: CONCERNS; overall story risk score 75/100 (High).
- **Blocking Risks:** TECH-001 (ordering races) and OPS-001 (abort propagation) must be mitigated with tests before enabling flag.
- **Recommended Testing:** Add deterministic Jest suites for staggered latencies, abort races, and cap boundaries; plan chaos runs once runners integrate.
- **Follow-Up:** Re-run risk profile after coordinator utilities merge and telemetry confirms stable abort metrics.

### Review Date: 2025-09-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

#### Code Quality Assessment

- Verified scheduler abort guard prevents late settle overwrites; no additional refactoring required.
- Scope limited to utility moduleâ€”no new configuration or runner changes introduced in this story.

#### Test & Evidence Review

- Command: `npm test -- --runTestsByPath src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/utils/toolExecution.test.ts`
- Trace Matrix: `docs/qa/assessments/1.1-coordinator-utilities-trace-20250928.md`
- NFR Assessment: `docs/qa/assessments/1.1-coordinator-utilities-nfr-20250928.md`

#### Remaining Concerns

- Runner integrations (Stories 1.2 / 1.3) must consume the coordinator and confirm telemetry before lifting risk CONCERNS.

#### Gate Decision

- CONCERNS â€” see `docs/qa/gates/1.1-coordinator-utilities.yml`

#### Recommended Status

- Ready for Done once downstream runner integration stories complete and risk profile is re-run post-telemetry.
