# Story 1.1 PO Validation — Coordinator Utilities

Date: 2025-09-28
Validator: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed

- Story draft: `docs/stories/1.1.coordinator-utilities.md`
- Epic source: `docs/prd/epic-1-parallel-tool-execution.md`
- Architecture references: `docs/architecture/4-interfaces-typescript.md`, `docs/architecture/5-coordinator-design.md`, `docs/architecture/7-config-feature-flags.md`, `docs/architecture/12-testing-strategy.md`
- QA artifacts: `docs/qa/assessments/1.1-coordinator-utilities-risk-20250928.md`, `docs/qa/assessments/1.1-coordinator-utilities-test-design-20250928.md`

## Template Compliance

- All required sections from `story-tmpl.yaml` present (Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes with Testing subsection, Change Log, Dev Agent Record, QA Results).
- No unresolved placeholders or `_TBD_` tokens detected.
- Structure matches template ordering and supports downstream agent workflows.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None. Story remains implementation-ready pending execution of already captured follow-up tasks (abort cleanup test, microtask flush helper).

## Should-Fix Items

- None. Tasks and Dev Notes provide sufficient specificity on file locations, configuration handling, and testing expectations.

## Nice-to-Have Improvements

- Optional: include explicit reference to telemetry spans (`tool.start` / `tool.settle`) in Dev Notes once instrumentation story lands for clarity with observability team. Current mention under Risk profile is adequate for this story scope.

## Acceptance Criteria & Task Coverage

- Each AC mapped to at least one task/subtask with architecture citations; concurrency cap, hooks, abort handling, and unit-test coverage addressed.
- Dev Notes summarize required interfaces, configuration defaults, and backward-compatibility guarantees as defined in architecture shards.

## Anti-Hallucination Review

- All technical claims trace back to architecture or PRD sections; no unsupported libraries or patterns introduced.
- Terminology (e.g., `ToolCall`, `ExecHooks`, concurrency limits) aligns with canonical definitions in architecture documentation.

## Final Assessment

- **Decision:** GO — Story is ready for development.
- **Implementation Readiness Score:** 9 / 10
- **Confidence Level:** High
- **Conditions:** Ensure follow-up tasks from QA/Researcher logs (abort listener cleanup test, microtask flush helper, CI runtime monitoring) are tracked in the implementation plan.

## Addendum (2025-09-28 Post-QA Review)

- QA gate recorded CONCERNS pending runner integrations and telemetry. Decision remains GO with acknowledgement that enabling the feature still requires completion of downstream stories (1.2/1.3) and a subsequent risk profile rerun.
- No additional PO actions required until runner integration work completes; monitor QA recommendations before release toggle.
