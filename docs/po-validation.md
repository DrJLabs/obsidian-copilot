# PO Master Validation — Brownfield Service/API

Date: 2025-09-27

## Inputs Reviewed

- Baseline: `docs/document-project.md` — present: **True** — sha: `468d25407daa`
- PRD: `docs/prd.md` — present: **True** — sha: `3b876d7a2d2f`
- Architecture: `docs/architecture.md` — present: **True** — sha: `f3aba3bbc27a`

## Summary

Project type: **Brownfield-Service**. Artifacts exist and align with workflow requirements.

**Decision:** **APPROVED**

## Key Checks

- Requirements complete for scope and constraints: **OK**
- Protocol stability guaranteed (`<use_tool>` XML, ordered outputs, markers): **OK**
- Runner integration plan preserves deterministic ordering: **OK**
- Feature flag and concurrency cap defined: **OK**
- Abort, timeouts, gating parity with sequential path: **OK**
- Test plan includes unit, integration, snapshot, chaos: **OK**
- Observability plan (latency, wall time, errors, rate limits): **OK**
- Rollout with safe fallback and cohort gate: **OK**

## Pre-Dev Notes

- Default cap set to 4; configurable. **Note**: tune after internal cohort telemetry.
- Ensure snapshot tests assert byte-for-byte equality for prompt/context outputs.

## Next Step (per workflow)

- **Shard documents** for implementation (`PO action: shard_documents`), producing `/docs/prd/` and `/docs/architecture/` shards for IDE handoff.
