# Story Validation Report — Story 1.2: Autonomous Runner Integration (2025-09-29)

Validator: Sarah (Product Owner)
Implementation Readiness Score: 9 / 10
Confidence Level: High
Decision: **GO** — Story ready for development hand-off

## Template Compliance Review

- ✅ All required sections from `story-tmpl.yaml` are present (Status, Story, ACs, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes with Testing, Change Log, Dev Agent Record, QA Results).
- ✅ No placeholder tokens or unfilled template variables remain; `_TBD_` entries are limited to Dev Agent Record fields reserved for implementation.
- ✅ Structure aligns with template ordering and heading hierarchy.

## File Structure & Source Tree

- ✅ Tasks reference concrete code locations (`src/LLMProviders/chainRunner/AutonomousAgentChainRunner.ts`, `toolResultUtils.ts`) consistent with Architecture §3 and PRD integration points.
- ✅ Dev Notes highlight reuse of coordinator utilities delivered in Story 1.1 and specify test file placement alongside runner utilities.
- ✅ No conflicting or ambiguous path guidance detected.

## UI / Frontend Applicability

- N/A — Story targets runner orchestration; no UI components introduced.

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

- ✅ Each AC is explicitly mapped to tasks/subtasks and Dev Notes context.
- ✅ Success measures rely on ordered markers, prompt parity, and abort handling, all testable.
- ✅ Feature-flag fallbacks and concurrency clamps covered via AC3 tasks.

## Testing & Validation Guidance

- ✅ Testing section references Architecture §12 expectations (staggered latency, abort, cap boundaries, prompt snapshots).
- ✅ Tasks include explicit instruction to add integration tests and telemetry checks, aligning with QA risk mitigations.

## Security & Compliance

- ✅ Dev Notes reference Architecture §10 (no new data surfaces) and §2 constraints on background tools.
- ✅ No additional security gaps identified; reuse of existing Plus gating emphasized.

## Task Sequence & Dependencies

- ✅ Implementation tasks proceed logically: integrate coordinator, thread signals/config, emit telemetry, then add tests.
- ✅ Dependency on Story 1.1 marked in Previous Story Insights, ensuring prerequisites verified before work begins.

## Anti-Hallucination Check

- ✅ All technical statements link to PRD or Architecture sections; no invented APIs or undocumented strategies detected.
- ✅ Coordinator behavior and configuration limits mirror source documents.

## Should-Fix / Improvements

- None required before development.

## Nice-to-Have Enhancements

- Consider adding a short note in Dev Notes pointing to the new QA risk profile (`docs/qa/assessments/1.2-autonomous-runner-integration-risk-20250929.md`) for quick cross-reference once QA finishes planning.

---

Story readiness confirmed. Proceed to engineering implementation after optional enhancement above.

## Revalidation Notes (2025-09-29)

- Confirmed QA gate PASS after new coordinator helper tests and telemetry instrumentation.
- Outstanding follow-up: capture production benchmark prior to flag rollout.
