# 13) Test Plan

## Unit (utils)

- Ordering preserved with varied latencies.
- Timeout and error propagation identical to sequential.
- Abort stops UI hook calls.

## Integration (runners)

- 5â€“10 mixed tools with staggered latencies: banners update per settle; final strings identical to sequential.
- Copilot+ `localSearch` post-processing parity.

## Snapshot

- Prompt/context output byte-for-byte equality where applicable.

## Chaos

- Random failures/timeouts; verify partial success aggregation and non-blocking behavior.
