## Copilot V3 is a New Era üî•

After months of hard work, we have revamped the codebase and adopted a new paradigm for our agentic infrastructure. It opens the door for easier addition of agentic tools (MCP support coming). We will provide a new version of the documentation soon. Here is a couple of new things that you cannot miss!

- FOR ALL USERS: You can do vault search out-of-the-box **without building an index first** (Indexing is still available but optional behind the "Semantic Search" toggle in QA settings).
- FOR FREE USERS: Image support and chat context menu are available to all users starting from v3.0.0!
- FOR PLUS USERS: Autonomous agent is available with vault search, web search, youtube, composer and soon a lot other tools!

Read the [Changelog](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot/releases/tag/3.0.0).

## Why People Love It ‚ù§Ô∏è

- *"Copilot is the missing link that turns Obsidian into a true second brain. I use it to draft investment memos with text, code, and visuals‚Äîall in one place. It‚Äôs the first tool that truly unifies how I search, process, organize, and retrieve knowledge without ever leaving Obsidian. With AI-powered search, organization, and reasoning built into my notes, it unlocks insights I‚Äôd otherwise miss. My workflow is faster, deeper, and more connected than ever‚ÄîI can‚Äôt imagine working without it."*¬†- @jasonzhangb, Investor & Research Analyst
- *"Since discovering Copilot, my writing process has been completely transformed. Conversing with my own articles and thoughts is the most refreshing experience I‚Äôve had in decades.‚Äù*¬†- Mat QV, Writer
- *"Copilot has transformed our family‚Äînot just as a productivity assistant, but as a therapist. I introduced it to my non‚Äëtechnical wife, Mania, who was stressed about our daughter‚Äôs upcoming exam; within an hour, she gained clarity on her mindset and next steps, finding calm and confidence."*¬†- @screenfluent, A Loving Husband
