Use environment variables to store sensitive credentials, avoid storing tokens in plaintext or public repos, and leverage official SDKs or Terraform providers for stable integrations. Refer to the API documentation for endpoint details and use JSON processors like `jq` to format responses during development[2][3][6].\n\n2) **Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics example queries for `httpRequests1dGroups`** are used to retrieve grouped HTTP request analytics data aggregated daily. While specific example queries are not in the search results, Cloudflare’s GraphQL Analytics API allows querying metrics such as requests, bandwidth, and threats, grouped by dimensions like zone or country. The official docs provide schema and query examples for building such queries[6].\n\n3) **Cloudflare Terraform provider rate limit settings and tips**: The Terraform provider respects Cloudflare API rate limits automatically but users should design infrastructure as code to minimize unnecessary API calls. Use Terraform state locking and plan/apply workflows to avoid hitting rate limits. For very large deployments, consider splitting resources or using API retries with exponential backoff. Specific rate limit configurations are managed by Cloudflare and not exposed directly in Terraform[6].\n\n4) **Wrangler CLI deploy commands for Workers, KV, D1, and R2 automation**: Wrangler CLI supports commands like `wrangler deploy` to deploy Workers scripts, `wrangler kv:namespace create` and `wrangler kv:bulk put` for KV storage, `wrangler d1` commands for D1 database management, and `wrangler r2` commands for R2 object storage. These commands can be scripted in CI/CD pipelines for automation. Environment variables and secrets can be managed via Wrangler for secure deployments[4].\n\n5) **Cloudflare API token scopes least privilege examples**: When creating API tokens, assign only the minimum necessary permissions, e.g., for Workers deployment, use the “Edit Cloudflare Workers” template or custom tokens with only `workers_scripts` write access. For Pages deployments, grant only `Pages Read` or `Pages Write` as needed. Avoid using global or full account permissions to reduce risk[1][6].\n\n6) **Cloudflare OpenAPI schemas GitHub api-schemas usage to generate clients**: Cloudflare provides OpenAPI schemas on GitHub for their APIs, which can be used with tools like Swagger Codegen or OpenAPI Generator to create client libraries in various languages. This facilitates building custom integrations with type-safe API clients, improving developer productivity and reducing errors. The schemas reflect the v4 API endpoints and payloads[3][6].\n\n7) **Cloudflare Rulesets CRUD API modern rulesets vs legacy firewall**: Cloudflare’s modern firewall rulesets API supports CRUD operations on rulesets that replace legacy firewall rules. Rulesets offer more granular and flexible security controls, including managed rules, rate limiting, and bot management. The API enables creating, updating, and deleting rulesets programmatically, facilitating automation and integration with security workflows[6][5].\n\n8) **Cloudflare API rate limits 429 backoff recommendations**: When receiving HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses, implement exponential backoff with jitter to retry requests. Respect Cloudflare’s rate limiting policies by spreading out API calls, caching results where possible, and using pagination to limit data per request. Advanced rate limiting rules can be configured to protect resources from abuse[5][6].\n\n9) **Automating Cloudflare with AI playbook examples and case studies**: While specific AI-dr … [truncated 1086 chars]

For Workers (which might be used to process or trigger GraphQL queries), pricing is based on the number of requests and CPU time consumed, with example costs ranging from a few dollars to tens of dollars per month depending on usage[2].\\n\\nKey points about Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics query limits and cost:\\n\\n- **Rate limits:** Max 320 GraphQL queries per 5 minutes per user/account token, varying by query cost (complex queries consume more quota)[1].\\n- **Default quota:** 300 queries per 5 minutes for typical users[4].\\n- **Query cost:** Depends on the complexity and data volume requested; more complex queries consume more of the quota.\\n- **Enterprise options:** Higher limits can be requested via Cloudflare Support[1].\\n- **Pricing:** No direct per-query charge mentioned; costs arise from related services like Workers CPU time and requests if used to run or process queries[2].\\n- **Settings node:** Allows discovery of dataset limits such as max fields, max page size, and max duration per query, which indirectly affect query cost and performance[3].\\n\\nIn summary, Cloudflare controls GraphQL Analytics query performance and cost primarily through **rate limiting based on query cost**, with a default cap of around 300-320 queries per 5 minutes, adjustable for enterprise customers. Costs are more related to associated services like Workers rather than the queries themselves[1][3][4][2].\",\"citations\":[\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/limits/\",\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/\",\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/settings/\",\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/limits/\",\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/limits/\",\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/platform/pricing/\",\"https://muttoni.github.io/blog/cloudflare/2021/04/15/Using-GraphQL-To-Query-Your-Cloudflare-Analytics.html\",\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-graphql-analytics-api-exactly-the-data-you-need-all-in-one-place/\",\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/getting-analytics/fetching-bulk-analytics/\",\"https://rollout.com/integration-guides/cloudflare-api-key/api-essentials\",\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/\",\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/observability/metrics-analytics/\",\"https://pages.johnspurlock.com/graphql-schema-docs/cloudflare.html\"],\"instruction\":\"\\n\\nWEB CITATION RULES:\\n1.

However, you can manage KV namespaces and deploy Workers with Wrangler, and implement canary deployments by leveraging environment targeting and deployment strategies outside Wrangler itself.\\n\\nKey points and approach:\\n\\n- **Wrangler CLI commands for KV, D1, and R2**: Wrangler supports commands like `wrangler kv:namespace create`, `wrangler kv:key put`, and commands to manage D1 databases and R2 storage. You deploy Workers using `wrangler deploy` which publishes your Worker and its bindings (KV, D1, R2) to Cloudflare[2][6][7].\\n\\n- **Canary deployment concept**: Canary deployment means releasing a new version of your application or Worker to a small subset of users before full rollout, to reduce risk[1][3][5].\\n\\n- **Implementing canary with Wrangler**: Wrangler itself does not have a native \\\"canary\\\" flag or command. Instead, you can:\\n\\n - Use **environments** in `wrangler.toml` to define multiple deployment targets (e.g., `production`, `canary`).\\n\\n - Deploy your Worker to a canary environment (e.g., `wrangler deploy --env canary`).\\n\\n - Use Cloudflare's **Traffic Splitting** feature on routes or Workers to route a percentage of traffic to the canary deployment.\\n\\n - Manage KV namespaces or D1/R2 bindings separately per environment if needed.\\n\\n- **Example workflow**:\\n\\n 1. Define environments in `wrangler.toml` with different KV/D1/R2 bindings or Worker names.\\n\\n 2. Deploy the canary version with `wrangler deploy --env canary`.\\n\\n 3. Configure Cloudflare routes or load balancing to send a small percentage of traffic to the canary Worker.\\n\\n 4. Monitor and then promote the canary to full production by deploying to the production environment.\\n\\n- **Additional automation**: You can script Wrangler commands in CI/CD pipelines and use Cloudflare API or Terraform to automate traffic splitting for canary releases.\\n\\n- **No direct Wrangler canary command**: Unlike some platforms (e.g., AWS API Gateway has `create-deployment` with canary settings[3]), Wrangler does not provide a direct canary deployment command or orchestrator.\\n\\nIn summary, **Wrangler CLI manages KV, D1, and R2 resources and deploys Workers, but canary deployments require using Wrangler environments combined with Cloudflare traffic routing features to achieve canary release patterns**. You deploy different versions to different environments and control traffic distribution externally from Wrangler commands[2][6][7][1][3][5].\",\"citations\":[\"https://docs.digital.ai/deploy/docs/22.1/how-to/perform-canary-deployments\",\"https://blog.ericcfdemo.net/posts/cloudflare-workers-and-kv/\",\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/create-canary-deployment.html\",\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/10566\",\"https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/rolling-deploy.html\",\"https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/cloudflare-workers\",\"https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-action\",\"https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/feature-experimentation/docs/deployment-guide-for-cloudflare-workers\",\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/\",\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/\",\"https://stackify.com/canary-deployments/\",\"https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/d … [truncated 888 chars]
