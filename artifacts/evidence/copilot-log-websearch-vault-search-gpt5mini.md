Start with scoped API tokens, then compose tasks into idempotent automations your AI can run end‑to‑end. [^1]\n- Keep IDs and scope straight: Account vs Zone; verify tokens and resource IDs before calling. See [[Cloudflare API]] for endpoint patterns and pitfalls. [^2]\n- Notable 2025 API changes to be aware of: list endpoints for Tunnel and Zero Trust Networks now only return active resources by default (must set `is_deleted=true` to retrieve deleted resources as of Dec 1, 2025) and several legacy endpoints/APIs were deprecated in favor of Rulesets and newer DNS settings APIs. [^8]\n## 1) Authentication and Scopes\n- Prefer API tokens (least privilege) over global keys; assign explicit permissions by resource type (Zone, Account, User). [^3]\n- Practical env vars:\n - CF_API_TOKEN, CF_ACCOUNT_ID, CF_ZONE_ID\n- Standard headers:\n - Authorization: Bearer $CF_API_TOKEN\n  - Content-Type: application/json\n  - Accept: application/json\n- Scope planning:\n  - Map workflows to scopes using [[account-permission-options]] and Cloudflare’s permission reference. [^3]\n- Token best practices (practical additions)\n  - Create a token per automation capability (DNS edit, Rulesets edit, Analytics read, Workers deploy). Limit to specific account/zone IDs rather than global scope. [^9]\n  - Use token restrictions where available: TTL/expiration, client IP allowlists, and rotation schedules. Store tokens in secret stores and rotate regularly. [^9]\n  - Avoid a single monolithic token — prefer many narrow tokens to minimize blast radius. [^9]\n## 2) Core Control Surfaces\n- REST v4 API (authoritative reference) — manage DNS, WAF/Rulesets, Access, Workers, R2, Load Balancers, etc. [^1]\n- GraphQL Analytics API — rich, single-endpoint analytics for security/perf dashboards and feedback loops. [^6]\n- Terraform Provider — declarative, Git‑tracked state across most Cloudflare products. [^4]\n- Wrangler CLI — Workers and Developer Platform lifecycle, plus admin for KV, D1, R2, Pub/Sub. [^5]\n- OpenAPI Schemas — machine‑readable specs to generate clients and AI tools. [^7]\n- Note: Cloudflare publishes OpenAPI schema files in the cloudflare/api-schemas GitHub repo to support client generation and validation. Consider pinning schema revisions for tooling stability. [^10]\n## 3) Canonical Base and IDs\n- Base: https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4 (REST); GraphQL endpoint per docs. [^1][^6]\n- Always use real IDs (account, zone, resource) in paths; name strings won’t work. See [[Cloudflare API]]. [^2]\n- 2025 list endpoint behavior: certain list endpoints (Tunnel, Zero Trust Networks) changed default behavior — they now return only active resources unless `is_deleted=true` is explicitly provided. Audit automation that expects deleted items and add explicit query params where needed. [^8]\n## 4) Tokens and Permissions (AI Playbook)\n- Create a token per automation “capability” (e.g., “Zone DNS Edit for example.com”, “Account Rulesets Edit”). [^3]\n- Attach only needed permissions and limit to specific resources where possible. [^3]\n- Rotate regularly and store securely; prefer short‑lived use where available. [^3]\n- Practical enforcement: have automation assert expected scopes before performing actions and fail fast with clear diagnostics if scopes are insufficient.\n## 5) Quickstarts\n### 5.1 REST — DNS workflow (list → create → update → delete)\n- List:\n  - GET /zones/$CF_ZONE_ID/dns_records\n- Create:\n - POST /zones/$CF_ZONE_ID/dns_records with {"type":"A","name":"www","content":"203.0.113.10","ttl":300,"proxied":true}\n- Update:\n  - PUT or PATCH /zones/$CF_ZONE_ID/dns_records/$RECORD_ID\n- Delete:\n  - DELETE /zones/$CF_ZONE_ID/dns_records/$RECORD_ID\nSee [[Cloudflare API]] for more details and error hints. [^2]\n### 5.2 GraphQL Analytics — requests/time by zone\n- Use HTTP POST to the GraphQL endpoint with a query selecting datasets like httpRequests1dGroups, filtered by zone and date range. [^6]\n- Example query (daily requests & pageViews):\n  - POST to https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/graphql with a GraphQL body querying viewer → zones(filter:{zoneTag:"$CF_ZONE_ID"}) → httpRequests1dGroups(...) and summing requests/pageViews. Adjust filters/orderBy/limit as needed for your dashboard or anomaly detector. [^11]\n- Keep in mind GraphQL query quotas and cost: default limits are around 300–320 queries per 5 minutes and heavy queries consume more quota — design queries to page and aggregate efficiently. Consider caching results and using sampling for anomaly detection loops. [^14]\n### 5.3 Terraform — manage Cloudflare as code\n- Initialize provider and authenticate via env `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`.\n- Use resources for DNS, Tunnels, Access, Rulesets, Workers bindings; enable provider‑level rate‑limit tuning if needed. [^4]\n- Rate‑limit / rate‑limiting rules as Terraform resources:\n - Use `cloudflare_rate_limit` (or Rulesets resources) to codify rate limiting and testing via `simulate` mode before enforcement. Example resource patterns and parameters (threshold, period, match, action) can be managed in Terraform. [^12]\n- Provider customization:\n - In CI, tune provider concurrency and request pacing (provider-specific env vars like `$CLOUDFLARE_RPS` or provider config) to avoid hitting API limits during large operations. [^12]\n- Fit for AI: generate plans, review diffs, and apply with policy checks in CI.\n### 5.4 Wrangler — Workers/R2/KV/D1 admin\n- Install via npm; `wrangler login` for auth; `wrangler deploy` to ship Workers; manage KV/D1/R2/Pub/Sub via subcommands. [^5]\n- Wrangler does not provide a one-shot \"canary\" command; instead, implement canary deployments with environments plus Cloudflare routing/traffic‑splitting or Workers KV routing flags. Pattern:\n - Define `environments` in `wrangler.toml` (production, canary).\n - Deploy canary: `wrangler deploy --env canary`.\n - Route a percentage of traffic to canary via Cloudflare configuration (Traffic Splitting, routes, or hashing in edge code using KV). Monitor, then promote. [^13]\n- Fit for AI: scaffold Workers, wire bindings, run preview/dev, and promote via environments.\n## 6) Rulesets (WAF/Redirects/Transforms/Cache)\n- Prefer modern Rulesets over legacy firewall/WAF endpoints.\n- CRUD at account or zone level; pick matching scopes (e.g., Zone — WAF Edit, Transform Rules Edit, Cache Rules Edit). See patterns in [[Cloudflare API]]. [^2]\n- Migration note: Cloudflare has an upgrade path for legacy WAF/firewall rules to the new Rulesets engine; follow the migration guidance, import into Terraform as `cloudflare_ruleset` resources where applicable, and create exceptions to avoid lockouts during migration. Some upgrades are irreversible — test in staging first. [^15]\n## 7) Governance and Safety Rails\n- Rate limits exist and vary by product; handle 429 with backoff. [[Cloudflare API]] outlines typical account caps and exceptions. [^2]\n- Separate tokens per automation surface; run dry‑runs where available (Terraform plan).\n- Establish preview → rollout flow (Wrangler environments, staged Rulesets).\n- 429 handling (practical recipe):\n - Honor the `Retry-After` header in 429 responses and use it as the initial delay. [^16]\n - Apply exponential backoff (double delay on subsequent 429s) up to a max cap, and circuit-break to fail with an alert after N retries. [^16]\n - Centralize retry logic in a shared client or proxy t … [truncated 16990 chars]
