Custom rules can detect and act on sensitive data (e.g., PII) in prompts, with options to allow exceptions as needed[2].\\n- **Prompt Protection**: Beyond simple pattern matching, Cloudflare’s AI prompt protection uses operation mapping to understand application APIs and user actions. This enables action-based policies (e.g., “block the ‘share’ action from ChatGPT”) for granular control over AI usage[4].\\n- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Cloudflare’s SASE platform scans and blocks sensitive data from being entered into AI tools, preventing data leakage. Policies can be tailored to detect organization-specific sensitive information[6].\\n- **Visibility and Analytics**: Administrators gain visibility into LLM interactions through Security Analytics and Security Events, helping to detect risks and enforce controls[2].\\n- **Stateful Security**: Durable Objects ensure that agent state and memory are persisted securely, with identity boundaries that help scope access and data isolation per user or task[3].\\n\\n## Summary Table\\n\\n| Pattern | Description | Security Integration |\\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\\n| Prompt Chaining | Sequential LLM calls | WAF rules, prompt protection |\\n| Routing | Input classification to specialized tasks | Action-based policies, DLP |\\n| Parallelization | Simultaneous task processing | Real-time monitoring, analytics |\\n| Orchestrator-Workers | Central task breakdown and delegation | Stateful execution, access control |\\n| Evaluator-Optimizer | Response generation with feedback loop | Continuous risk assessment |\\n\\n## Key Takeaways\\n\\n- **Cloudflare’s AI orchestration patterns enable modular, scalable agent workflows**[1].\\n- **Security is deeply integrated**, with real-time filtering, granular action-based policies, and data loss prevention[2][4][6].\\n- **Persistent, stateful execution** via Durable Objects ensures secure, isolated agent contexts[3].\\n- **Administrators have extensive visibility and control** over AI interactions and data flows[2][4].\\n\\nThese features make Cloudflare a robust platform for both the technical orchestration and the secure operation of AI agents in production environments.\",\"citations\":[\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/patterns/\",\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/take-control-of-public-ai-application-security-with-cloudflare-firewall-for-ai/\",\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-agents-with-openai-and-cloudflares-agents-sdk/\",\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-prompt-protection/\",\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-realtime-voice-ai/\",\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/best-practices-sase-for-ai/\",\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45405584\",\"https://www.cloudflare.com/the-net/building-cyber-resilience/secure-govern-ai-agents/\",\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/concepts/workflows/\",\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/fr-fr/fedramphigh-ai/\",\"https://www.madrona.com/ai-agent-infrastructure-three-layers-tools-data-orchestration/\",\"https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/responsible-ai/\",\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-ai-partner-models/\",\"https://cyberpress.org/cloudflare-introduces-ai-labyrinth-to-thwart-ai-crawlers/\",\"https://www.getguru.com/reference/cloudflare-ai-agent\"],\"instruction\":\"\\n\\nWEB CITATION RULES:\\n1.

Custom rules can detect and act on sensitive data (e.g., PII) in prompts, with options to allow exceptions as needed[2].\\n- **Prompt Protection**: Beyond simple pattern matching, Cloudflare’s AI prompt protection uses operation mapping to understand application APIs and user actions. This enables action-based policies (e.g., “block the ‘share’ action from ChatGPT”) for granular control over AI usage[4].\\n- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: … [truncated 3986 chars]

2025-10-01T02:17:55.924Z INFO Final AI response (truncated):\n Okay, I will execute 10 web searches in parallel based on the content of the provided note "Cloudflare Programmatic Control" to expand upon it. Here are the search queries I will use:\n1. "Cloudflare REST API v4 examples"\n2. "Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics API best practices"\n3. "Cloudflare Terraform provider advanced configuration"\n4. "Cloudflare Wrangler CLI canary deployments"\n5. "Cloudflare OpenAPI schema client generation"\n6. "Cloudflare Rulesets vs legacy WAF performance"\n7. "Cloudflare API rate limit handling exponential backoff"\n8. "Cloudflare AI orchestration patterns security"\n9. "Cloudflare token rotation best practices"\n10. "Cloudflare account vs zone ID clarification"\nOkay, I have completed the 10 web searches. Here's a summary of the findings, expanding upon the original note "Cloudflare Programmatic Control":\n**1. Cloudflare REST API v4 Examples:**\n* The base URL for Cloudflare API v4 requests is `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/` [^1].\n* Authentication requires an API token in the header as `Authorization: Bearer &lt;API_TOKEN&gt;` [^1].\n\* `curl` is commonly used with the Bearer token header for command-line API calls [^3].\n**2. Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics API Best Practices:**\n* Limit query depth using libraries like `graphql-depth-limit` to prevent resource-intensive requests [^6].\n* Select only necessary datasets and metrics (e.g., `httpRequests1dGroups` for HTTP request analytics) [^1].\n\* Use filters and aggregations to refine data, such as filtering by date or zone [^1].\n**3. Cloudflare Terraform Provider Advanced Configuration:**\n* Increase the default API rate limit (1,200 requests per 5 minutes) for Enterprise customers via environment variables like `CLOUDFLARE_RPS` [^2].\n* Import existing Cloudflare resources into Terraform state using resource IDs and configuration files; tools like `cf-terraforming` can help [^4].\n**4. Cloudflare Wrangler CLI Canary Deployments:\*\*\n\_ Use `wrangler versions uploa... (truncated)
